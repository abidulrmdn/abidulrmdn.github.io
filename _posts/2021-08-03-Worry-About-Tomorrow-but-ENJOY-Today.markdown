This isn’t going to be a long read. but, it’s something I realized and made sense to me even though its so obvious.

After a long years of travel, experience of working in many places, meeting lots of people, and trying to figure out life, I’ve come to a conclusion that balances things out in my and other people’s life

My conclusion is :

> Enjoy the moment whilst thinking ahead for the moments to come and how to make best out f them.

Now! “enjoy” might mean different things and thats something up for people to decide and people would debate about. Me, in general I do say live today like there is no tomorrow enjoy the small steps that you take toward anything you want to reach.

And by “worry about tomorrow”, I mean have a plan for tomorrow, whatever the plan is and whatever tomorrow means. it could be a visit to someone planned ahead, a project to start a year from now, or it could be a date after a week. Just make sure to prepare for “tomorrow”.

The first part is super crucial; I realized that whatever goal or achievement you want to reach, the achievement itself wont really bring you the happiness as an end, what does, is the road taking you there. The joy you get on a daily basis while being motivated to reach something while doing the small steps is what enjoy today means.

I hope those words meant something or achieved something good in you like it did to me.
