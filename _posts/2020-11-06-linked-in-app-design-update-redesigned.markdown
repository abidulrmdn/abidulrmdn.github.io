Linkedin just updated its app with a brand new design inside the app.

## The design touched the main UI:

Which now contains a couple of info regarding messages, updates and so.

And I can see they’ve added some weird new search method by QR, which maybe was there before but wasn’t visible

This was a very quick review of the design I hope it was useful.
