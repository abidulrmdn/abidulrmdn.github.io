Youtube is a product by Google, which everyone knows and everyone expects Google’s product to not fail.

But It seems that youtube been having issues this morning around 11:56am GMT.

It’s giving a 503 error

> The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 503 Service Unavailable server error response code indicates that the server is not ready to handle the request. Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded.

This means that either youtube is getting attacked, overloaded or somehow doing some maintenance that didn’t go as planned
What’s shocking though, that even the offline downloads are also not working.

## Quick fix for some of the services:
Somehow currently, if you open youtube in the incognito tab without signing in, it will work.

## Other services that went down:
- Gmail 502
